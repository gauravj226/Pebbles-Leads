## ðŸš€ CI Strategy: Continuous Integration & Feature Flagging  

Our project follows a **Continuous Integration (CI) strategy** for version control, ensuring that changes are frequently merged, tested, and deployed with minimal disruptions. This approach allows us to maintain a stable codebase while accelerating development cycles.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Benefits:  
- **Frequent Code Integration** â€“ Developers commit changes regularly, reducing merge conflicts and improving collaboration.  
- **Feature Flagging for Safe Releases** â€“ New features are deployed behind feature flags, enabling controlled rollouts, A/B testing, and quick rollbacks if needed.  
- **Faster & More Reliable Deployments** â€“ Reduces deployment risks by ensuring only well-tested, stable features reach production.  

This approach enhances **agility, stability, and scalability**, enabling seamless innovation while minimizing risk. ðŸš€
