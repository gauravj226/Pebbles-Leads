# Pebbles-Leads
Pebbles leads the way is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Simplified Information Access at University of Esssex

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide students, staff, and visitors at the University of Essex (UoE) with a seamless way to access university-related information. By integrating retrieval-based search with generative AI, the system efficiently pulls data from trusted university resourcesâ€”such as the University and the Students' Union events websites, campus guides, and FAQsâ€”and generates concise, contextually relevant responses in real time.

Users can ask natural language queries about academic programs, campus facilities, events, activities and societie, and more, eliminating the need to manually sift through multiple web pages or documents. The system continuously improves through user feedback and adaptive learning, ensuring up-to-date and accurate information delivery.

This AI-powered tool enhances knowledge accessibility, reduces information overload, and improves overall user experience at UoE, making university resources more intuitive and readily available for everyone.
